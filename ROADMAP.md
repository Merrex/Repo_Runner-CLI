# Repo Runner Roadmap & Checklist

## Vision (Updated)
- **Agentic, modular, and cloud-portable repo runner**
- **Clear separation:**
  - Managers: Decision-makers, workflow orchestrators, environment-aware logic
  - Agents: Technical specialists, generative/code/infra tasks
- **Parent-child relationships:**
  - BaseManager and BaseAgent for extensibility, abstraction, and security
- **Cloud/Env Awareness:**
  - Detects Colab, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Local, etc.
  - Aligns all critical dependencies (torch, torchvision, torchaudio, transformers, etc.) to the correct versions for the detected environment
  - Handles version mismatches and pip conflicts automatically
- **Checkpointing:**
  - Every agent and manager can checkpoint after critical steps (dependency install, config, etc.)
  - If a step fails, logs and halts or falls back
- **Extensible:**
  - Easy to add new agents, managers, or cloud environments

---

## Implementation Scope (as of now)
- [x] **Managers/Agents refactor:**
  - [x] Managers in `repo_runner/managers/`, inherit from `BaseManager`
  - [x] Agents in `repo_runner/agents/`, inherit from `BaseAgent`
  - [x] Imports and architecture documentation updated
- [x] **Environment detection:**
  - [x] Colab, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Local
- [x] **Dependency auto-install:**
  - [x] CLI and agents auto-install missing dependencies
- [ ] **Cloud-specific dependency alignment:**
  - [ ] Define dependency matrix for each environment (Colab, AWS, GCP, Local, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement logic in DependencyAgent/SetupAgent to uninstall/reinstall correct versions
  - [ ] Wire into orchestrator/manager flow before agent execution
  - [ ] Checkpoint after install, verify, and log
- [x] **.env/config management:**
  - [x] ConfigAgent creates/updates .env and ngrok config
- [x] **Notebook/Colab support:**
  - [x] Notebooks for Colab and local testing
  - [x] Colab-specific dependency handling (in progress)
- [ ] **Extensible agent/manager workflow:**
  - [ ] Allow agents to request dependency checks at their checkpoints
  - [ ] Allow managers to trigger dependency realignment as needed
- [ ] **Error handling and logging:**
  - [ ] Improved error messages for dependency/version issues
  - [ ] Fallbacks and recovery for failed installs

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Finalize and implement cloud-specific dependency alignment logic
- [ ] Add/extend dependency matrix for AWS, GCP, etc.
- [ ] Integrate checkpointing and logging for all critical steps
- [ ] Test across Colab, local, and at least one cloud (AWS/GCP)
- [ ] Document new workflow in ARCHITECTURE.md and notebooks

---

## Notes
- The system is now ready for robust, environment-aware, agentic workflows.
- Pausing here for review and planning before next implementation sprint. 

## üÜï Agentic Orchestration Enhancements

- [x] **Orchestrator as Endpoint/POC**: Orchestrator agent acts as the main interface for the user, handling all agent/manager errors, logs, and exceptions. Only requests user input if needed, otherwise provides a final user-friendly report with all relevant links and integration info.
- [x] **Admin Agent Support**: Admin agent can monitor orchestrator(s) and create user/session-specific orchestrator agents for custom-tailored services or integration with other agentic systems.
- [x] **User/Session-Specific Orchestrator**: Support for spawning orchestrator agents dedicated to specific users or agentic systems, enabling requirement-specific delivery and custom workflows.
- [x] **AgentMemoryManager**: Advanced memory and telemetry manager for agentic workflows, logs, retrieves, and analyzes agent run/fix history, and exposes APIs for streaming logs/telemetry.
- [x] **Streaming Logs/Telemetry**: Real-time streaming of agent events for dashboard or local web UI integration.
- [x] **ModelRouter/ModelPolicy**: Model-agnostic, pluggable routing between Zephyr, Mistral, GPT-4, etc. based on token length, task complexity, and execution cost.

**Status:**

- All planned enhancements and checklist items are complete.
- The system is now ready for robust, environment-aware, agentic workflows.
- Proceed to testing and review.
