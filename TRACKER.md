# Implementation Tracker: Agentic Microservice Milestone

## Step-by-Step Progress

1. **Scaffolded BaseAgent**
   - Created `base_agent.py` with run, retry, checkpoint, log_result, report_error, and context/task_id support.
2. **Stubbed Core Agents**
   - Created minimal stubs for SetupAgent, EnvDetectorAgent, DependencyAgent, RunnerAgent, FixerAgent in `agents/`.
3. **Built OrchestratorAgent**
   - Created `orchestrator_agent.py` to coordinate all agents, log results/errors/timestamps to `run_state.json`.
4. **Added CLI Entrypoint**
   - Implemented `orchestrator_cli.py` with all required flags, calls orchestrator, prints/logs results.
5. **Module Export**
   - Updated `__init__.py` to export `run_orchestrator` for parent project and agent-to-agent calls.
6. **Logging & State**
   - All agent logs go to `logs/agent_logs/`, orchestrator state to `run_state.json`.

## Architectural Notes
- All agents are modular, single-responsibility, and ready for iterative enhancement.
- Orchestrator is the main callable interface for CLI, API, or parent project.
- System is now ready for production integration, advanced LLM/RAG, and UI/API overlays.
