# Agentic System Roadmap (2024 Milestone)

## Milestone: Agentic Microservice Backend

- All core agents (setup, env, deps, run, fix) are modular and inherit from BaseAgent
- OrchestratorAgent is the main entrypoint for CLI, API, or parent project
- CLI supports all required flags and is ready for automation
- All state and logs are file-based for traceability and debugging
- System is ready for production integration, further LLM/RAG enhancement, and UI/API overlays

See TRACKER.md for a step-by-step log of how this milestone was achieved.

## 🎯 Vision
Build a robust, intelligent, modular CLI agent that can analyze any repository, auto-install dependencies, configure environments, run applications locally, and prepare for cloud deployment with comprehensive troubleshooting and self-healing capabilities.
